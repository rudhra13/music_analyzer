You sound like all you've heard by them is \"Nothing Else Matters\" and just gone \"they're a gooey love story band\" which is just plain ignorant. The only ballads they made prior to the 90s were songs that build to an intense climax, and were written about highly dark and sometimes disturbing subject matters. The majority of their work in the 80s (and debatably early 90s) were written for angsty young boys who wanted a way of venting. Listen to a song like \"Damage Inc.\" which starts out by lulling you into a false sense of security and then fucks you to death with it's speed and exhilaration. Or take the straight-ahead \"no bullshit\" attack of \"Dyers Eve\", and the almost cheesy celebration of metal throughout the the entirety of the first album.
